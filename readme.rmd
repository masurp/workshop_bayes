Welcome to the 2022 workshop on *Bayesian Statistics Using R*. This page will be used to distribute the slides, handouts, and other materials for this course. All material is free to re-use under the [CC-BY](https://github.com/masurp/workshop_bayes/blob/main/LICENSE.md) license.

In this workshop, you will receive an in-depth introduction to the Bayesian Framework of Data Analysis. You will learn about the infamous "Bayes Theorem" and how it can be used for "Bayesian Inference".  More practically, you will further learn how to run (generalized) linear models using a Bayesian framework as implemented in the R package [`brms`](http://paul-buerkner.github.io/brms/index.html) (BÃ¼rckner, 2017). You will learn how to specify models, appropriate priors, and how to interpret respective results. Thereby we will get to know different methods to draw probabilistic inferences from posterier distributions, moving beyond standard frequentist null hypothesis testing.

For this 2-day workshop, I expect you... 

1. to have R and RStudio installed. If you haven't done so yet, have a look at this [getting started](https://github.com/ccs-amsterdam/r-course-material/blob/master/tutorials/R_basics_1_getting_started.md) tutorial, which walks you through the installation and helps you get some first hands-on experience using R. 

2. to have some basic knowledge of R and particularly data wrangling skills (at best, some knowledge about the `tidyverse`). If this is still new to you, we have several videos and tutorials on our [R course material GitHub page](https://github.com/ccs-amsterdam/r-course-material) that can help you getting started. I would suggest to check out the tutorials on transforming, summarizing, visualizing and reshaping data in the "data wrangling with the tidyverse" category. 

3. a good understanding of a good understanding of descriptive statistics (distributions, parameters of central tendency) and frequentist inference (standard error, p-value, confidence intervals).

4. some basic knowledge of regression models (e.g., linear regression, logistic regression, multilevel linear regression). In the practical part of the workshop, we will fit such models in R. 

**Note:** The workshop will NOT provide an introduction to R!
