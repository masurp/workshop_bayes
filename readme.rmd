Welcome to the 2022 workshop on *Bayesian Statistics Using R*. This page will be used to distribute the slides, handouts, and other materials for this course. All material is free to re-use under the [CC-BY](https://github.com/masurp/workshop_bayes/blob/main/LICENSE.md) license.

## Preparation

For this 2-day workshop, I expect you to have R and RStudio installed. I also expect you to have a good understanding of frequentist statistics and a basic working experience with R. If you are new to R, we have several videos and tutorials on our [R course material GitHub page](https://github.com/ccs-amsterdam/r-course-material) that can help you getting started. At least, have a look at the "getting started" tutorial, which walks you through the installation and helps you get some first hands-on experience using R. 

Then, to become more proficient in R yourself, please complete some (or all) of the handouts in the "data mangling in the tidyverse" section. A strong understanding of the tidyverse is not required for this workshop, but completing these tutorials is a good and productive way to become used to working with R and RStudio.
