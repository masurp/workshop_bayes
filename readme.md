Welcome to the 2022 workshop on *Bayesian Statistics Using R*. This page
will be used to distribute the slides, handouts, and other materials for
this course. All material is free to re-use under the
[CC-BY](https://github.com/masurp/workshop_bayes/blob/main/LICENSE.md)
license.

In this workshop, you will receive an in-depth introduction to the
Bayesian Framework of Data Analysis. You will learn about the infamous
“Bayes Theorem” and how it can be used for “Bayesian Inference”. More
practically, you will further learn how to run (generalized) linear
models using a Bayesian framework as implemented in the R package
[`brms`](http://paul-buerkner.github.io/brms/index.html) (Bürckner,
2017). You will learn how to specify models, appropriate priors, and how
to interpret respective results. Thereby we will get to know different
methods to draw probabilistic inferences from posterier distributions,
moving beyond standard frequentist null hypothesis testing.

For this 2-day workshop, I expect you…

1.  to have R and RStudio installed. If you haven’t done so yet, have a
    look at this [getting
    started](https://github.com/ccs-amsterdam/r-course-material/blob/master/tutorials/R_basics_1_getting_started.md)
    tutorial, which walks you through the installation and helps you get
    some first hands-on experience using R. You do not need to install the packages
    that we will use in the workship yet. We will install those together in the workshop.

2.  to have some basic knowledge of R and particularly data wrangling
    skills (at best, some knowledge about the `tidyverse`). If this is
    still new to you, we have several videos and tutorials on our [R
    course material GitHub
    page](https://github.com/ccs-amsterdam/r-course-material) that can
    help you getting started. I would suggest to check out the tutorials
    on transforming, summarizing, visualizing and reshaping data in the
    “data wrangling with the tidyverse” category.

3.  a good understanding of descriptive statistics (distributions,
    parameters of central tendency) and frequentist inference (standard
    error, p-value, confidence intervals).

4.  some basic knowledge of regression models (e.g., linear regression,
    logistic regression, multilevel linear regression). In the practical
    part of the workshop, we will fit such models in R.

**Note:** The workshop will NOT provide an introduction to R!
