Welcome to the 2022 workshop on *Bayesian Statistics Using R*. This page
will be used to distribute the slides, handouts, and other materials for
this course. All material is free to re-use under the
[CC-BY](https://github.com/masurp/workshop_bayes/blob/main/LICENSE.md)
license.

## Preparation

For this 2-day workshop, I expect you to have R and RStudio installed
and a basic working experience with R (at beast also with the
`tidyverse`). I also expect you to have a good understanding of
descriptive statistics (distributions, parameters of central tendency)
and frequentist inference (standard error, p-value, confidence
intervals). If you are new to R, we have several videos and tutorials on
our [R course material GitHub
page](https://github.com/ccs-amsterdam/r-course-material) that can help
you getting started. At least, have a look at the “getting started”
tutorial, which walks you through the installation and helps you get
some first hands-on experience using R. Finally, in the applied part of
the workshop, we will focus on regression models (e.g., linear
regression, logistic regression, multilevel linear regression). A good
understanding of these models is also beneficial.
